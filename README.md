## Aim:

To use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm for a practical application, such as securing sensitive data transmission in financial transactions.

## ALGORITHM:

1. DES is based on a symmetric key encryption technique that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks.
2. DES uses a Feistel network structure with 16 rounds of processing for encryption.
3. DES has a 64-bit key, but only 56 bits are used for encryption (the remaining 8 bits are for parity).
4. DES applies initial and final permutations along with 16 rounds of substitution and permutation transformations to produce ciphertext.

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
void xorCrypt(char *in, char *key, char *out, int len)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) out[i] = in[i] ^ key[i % strlen(key)];
  out[len] = 0;
}
int main() 
{
  char msg[100], key[100], enc[100], dec[100];
  printf("Enter message: "); fgets(msg, 100, stdin);
  msg[strcspn(msg, "\n")] = 0;
  printf("Enter key: "); fgets(key, 100, stdin);
  key[strcspn(key, "\n")] = 0;

  int len = strlen(msg);
  xorCrypt(msg, key, enc, len);
  printf("Encrypted: ");
  for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) printf("%02X ", (unsigned char)enc[i]);
  printf("\n");

  xorCrypt(enc, key, dec, len);
  printf("Decrypted: %s\n", dec);
  return 0;
}
```

## Result:
Thus the C program to use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm for a practical application, such as securing sensitive data transmission in financial transactions is executed successfully.
  The program is executed successfully
